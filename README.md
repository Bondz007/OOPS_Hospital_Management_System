# 🏥 Hospital Management System

## Overview

Hospitals encounter significant challenges when it comes to the manual management and monitoring of patient data. Dealing with manual data often leads to mistakes and slow processes. This Hospital Management System is designed to streamline administrative tasks, reduce reliance on paper-based processes, and enhance the quality of patient care.

This system offers two interfaces:

- **Doctor Login**
- **Staff Login**

By developing a User-Friendly Graphical User Interface (GUI) using the Swing framework and integrating with the MySQL database via JDBC, this system aims to improve hospital efficiency and the overall patient experience.
